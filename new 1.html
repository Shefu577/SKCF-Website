	 SK Children Foundation is a non profit organization(NGO) that works 365 days a year to provide the best education to the underprivileged 
	 section of the society.
     SK Children Foundation aims to teach needy children subjects and life values that go beyond the horizon of normal schooling. 
	 We strongly believe that each and every child should get equal opportunities in terms of education and co-curricular activities.<br>

	    In 2016, Raghav Sharma, a class 12th student was buying some ice cream from a stall when he encountered some kids who asked him to buy them the treats. 
	    The kids were from a nearby slum and were looking malnourished. Being his creative self, Raghav asked the kids to recite the English alphabet in exchange 
		for ice cream. When they could not recall the alphabets, he realized something: the gap in society between the have is and the have-nots. In that very moment, 
		he asked himself- why should not every child be given the same basic opportunities to realise his/her potential?
		
        He believed that he must be the change he wants to see in the society. Hence he took immediate action and started teaching a couple of kids around the 
		neighbourhood in a nearby park in Janakpuri. He has not looked back ever since. The number of kids have grown from one to 150+, new dedicated members 
		have joined the cause, volunteers have helped on many occasions and numerous events have already been held.

        In 2019, the NGO was formally registered as SK Children Foundation as a public charitable trust. Contact us on the mentioned email or instagram and 
		facebook pages to connect with us. All the pictures and logs of our activities can be checked on our Instagram and Facebook pages: skchildrenfoundation.

         <p style="color:darkblue">As we all know that due to the current lockdown situation, daily wages labour are heavily effected. After a conversation with some parents who were 
         telephonically called  we come to know that there is a huge shortage of food. We at SKCF believe that it is our moral responsibility to come forward 
         and help them. Giving is not just about donations, it is about making a difference Thus, we are planning to distribute certain amount of flour, wheat, 
         rice, sugar, salt, oil, soap, pulses, masalas etc. to each family which will cost us around Rs. 500/- per set and we are aiming to feed 60-70 families. 
         Your smallest contribution will help these families to get proper supply of food. This all will only be possible when all of us come together and 
         donate for the cause.<br>
         All donations get a special mention on our website, Facebook and Instagram pages.
